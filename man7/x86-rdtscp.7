.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads the current value of the processor’s time-stamp counter (a 64-bit
MSR) into the EDX:EAX registers and also reads the value of the
IA32_TSC_AUX MSR (address C0000103H) into the ECX register. The EDX
register is loaded with the high-order 32 bits of the IA32_TSC MSR; the
EAX register is loaded with the low-order 32 bits of the IA32_TSC MSR;
and the ECX register is loaded with the low-order 32-bits of
IA32_TSC_AUX MSR. On processors that support the Intel 64
architecture, the high-order 32 bits of each of RAX, RDX, and RCX are
cleared.

.PP
The processor monotonically increments the time-stamp counter MSR every
clock cycle and resets it to 0 whenever the processor is reset. See
“Time Stamp Counter” in Chapter 18 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32
Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3B, for specific
details of the time stamp counter behavior.

.PP
The time stamp disable (TSD) flag in register CR4 restricts the use of
the RDTSCP instruction as follows. When the flag is clear, the RDTSCP
instruction can be executed at any privilege level; when the flag is
set, the instruction can only be executed at privilege level 0.

.PP
The RDTSCP instruction is not a serializing instruction, but it does
wait until all previous instructions have executed and all previous
loads are globally visible.1 But it does not wait for
previous stores to be globally visible, and subsequent instructions may
begin execution before the read operation is performed. The following
items may guide software seeking to order executions of RDTSCP:
.IP \(bu 2
If software requires RDTSCP to be executed only after all previous
stores are globally visible, it can execute MFENCE immediately
before RDTSCP.
.IP \(bu 2
If software requires RDTSCP to be executed prior to execution of any
subsequent instruction (including any memory accesses), it can
execute LFENCE immediately after RDTSCP.

.PP
See “Changes to Instruction Behavior in VMX Non-Root Operation” in
Chapter 26 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software
Developer’s Manual, Volume 3C, for more information about the behavior
of this instruction in VMX non-root operation.

1\&. A load is considered to become globally visible when the value to
be loaded is determined.
