.SH DESCRIPTION
Moves the quadword in the source operand (second operand) to the
destination operand (first operand) using a non-temporal hint to
minimize cache pollution during the write to memory. The source operand
is an MMX technology register, which is assumed to contain packed
integer data (packed bytes, words, or doublewords). The destination
operand is a 64-bit memory location.

.PP
The non-temporal hint is implemented by using a write combining (WC)
memory type protocol when writing the data to memory. Using this
protocol, the processor does not write the data into the cache
hierarchy, nor does it fetch the corresponding cache line from memory
into the cache hierarchy. The memory type of the region being written to
can override the non-temporal hint, if the memory address specified for
the non-temporal store is in an uncacheable (UC) or write protected (WP)
memory region. For more information on non-temporal stores, see “Caching
of Temporal vs. Non-Temporal Data” in Chapter 10 in the
Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s
Manual, Volume 1.

.PP
Because the WC protocol uses a weakly-ordered memory consistency model,
a fencing operation implemented with the SFENCE or MFENCE instruction
should be used in conjunction with MOVNTQ instructions if multiple
processors might use different memory types to read/write the
destination memory locations.

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.
