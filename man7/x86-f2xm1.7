D9 F0				Replace ST(0) with (2ST(0) – 1).

.SH DESCRIPTION
Computes the exponential value of 2 to the power of the source operand
minus 1. The source operand is located in register ST(0) and the result
is also stored in ST(0). The value of the source operand must lie in the
range –1.0 to +1.0. If the source value is outside this range, the
result is undefined.

.PP
The following table shows the results obtained when computing the
exponential value of various classes of numbers, assuming that neither
overflow nor underflow occurs.

.PP
Values other than 2 can be exponentiated using the following formula:

.PP
xy :=\\ 2(y ∗ log2x)

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.
