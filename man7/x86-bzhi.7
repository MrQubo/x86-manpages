.SH DESCRIPTION
BZHI copies the bits of the first source operand (the second operand)
into the destination operand (the first operand) and clears the higher
bits in the destination according to the INDEX value specified by the
second source operand (the third operand). The INDEX is specified by
bits 7:0 of the second source operand. The INDEX value is saturated at
the value of OperandSize -1. CF is set, if the number contained in the 8
low bits of the third operand is greater than OperandSize -1.

.PP
This instruction is not supported in real mode and virtual-8086 mode.
The operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64-bit mode. In 64-bit mode
operand size 64 requires VEX.W1. VEX.W1 is ignored in non-64-bit modes.
An attempt to execute this instruction with VEX.L not equal to 0 will
cause #UD.

.SH OPERATION
.EX
N := SRC2[7:0]
DEST := SRC1
IF (N < OperandSize)
    DEST[OperandSize-1:N] := 0
FI
IF (N > OperandSize - 1)
    CF := 1
ELSE
    CF := 0
FI
.EE

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
ZF and SF flags are updated based on the result. CF flag is set as
specified in the Operation section. OF flag is cleared. AF and PF flags
are undefined.
