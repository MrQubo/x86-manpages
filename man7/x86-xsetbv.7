.SH DESCRIPTION
Writes the contents of registers EDX:EAX into the 64-bit extended
control register (XCR) specified in the ECX register. (On processors
that support the Intel 64 architecture, the high-order 32 bits of RCX
are ignored.) The contents of the EDX register are copied to high-order
32 bits of the selected XCR and the contents of the EAX register are
copied to low-order 32 bits of the XCR. (On processors that support the
Intel 64 architecture, the high-order 32 bits of each of RAX and RDX are
ignored.) Undefined or reserved bits in an XCR should be set to values
previously read.

.PP
This instruction must be executed at privilege level 0 or in
real-address mode; otherwise, a general protection exception #GP(0) is
generated. Specifying a reserved or unimplemented XCR in ECX will also
cause a general protection exception. The processor will also generate a
general protection exception if software attempts to write to reserved
bits in an XCR.

.PP
Currently, only XCR0 is supported. Thus, all other values of ECX are
reserved and will cause a #GP(0). Note that bit 0 of XCR0
(corresponding to x87 state) must be set to 1; the instruction will
cause a #GP(0) if an attempt is made to clear this bit. In addition,
the instruction causes a #GP(0) if an attempt is made to set XCR0[2]
(AVX state) while clearing XCR0[1] (SSE state); it is necessary to set
both bits to use AVX instructions; Section 13.3, “Enabling the XSAVE
Feature Set and XSAVE-Enabled Features,” of Intel® 64 and
IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1.
