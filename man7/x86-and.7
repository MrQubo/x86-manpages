.SH DESCRIPTION
Performs a bitwise AND operation on the destination (first) and source
(second) operands and stores the result in the destination operand
location. The source operand can be an immediate, a register, or a
memory location; the destination operand can be a register or a memory
location. (However, two memory operands cannot be used in one
instruction.) Each bit of the result is set to 1 if both corresponding
bits of the first and second operands are 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.

.PP
This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the it to be
executed atomically.

.PP
In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits.
Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional
registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes
operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of this
section for encoding data and limits.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
The OF and CF flags are cleared; the SF, ZF, and PF flags are set
according to the result. The state of the AF flag is undefined.
