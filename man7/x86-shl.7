.SH DESCRIPTION
Shifts the bits in the first operand (destination operand) to the left
or right by the number of bits specified in the second operand (count
operand). Bits shifted beyond the destination operand boundary are first
shifted into the CF flag, then discarded. At the end of the shift
operation, the CF flag contains the last bit shifted out of the
destination operand.

.PP
The destination operand can be a register or a memory location. The
count operand can be an immediate value or the CL register. The count is
masked to 5 bits (or 6 bits with a 64-bit operand). The count range is
limited to 0 to 31 (or 63 with a 64-bit operand). A special opcode
encoding is provided for a count of 1.

.PP
The shift arithmetic left (SAL) and shift logical left (SHL)
instructions perform the same operation; they shift the bits in the
destination operand to the left (toward more significant bit locations).
For each shift count, the most significant bit of the destination
operand is shifted into the CF flag, and the least significant bit is
cleared (see Figure 7-7 in the
Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s
Manual, Volume 1).

.PP
The shift arithmetic right (SAR) and shift logical right (SHR)
instructions shift the bits of the destination operand to the right
(toward less significant bit locations). For each shift count, the least
significant bit of the destination operand is shifted into the CF flag,
and the most significant bit is either set or cleared depending on the
instruction type. The SHR instruction clears the most significant bit
(see Figure 7-8 in the
Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s
Manual, Volume 1); the SAR instruction sets or clears the most
significant bit to correspond to the sign (most significant bit) of the
original value in the destination operand. In effect, the SAR
instruction fills the empty bit position’s shifted value with the sign
of the unshifted value (see Figure 7-9
in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s
Manual, Volume 1).

.PP
The SAR and SHR instructions can be used to perform signed or unsigned
division, respectively, of the destination operand by powers of 2. For
example, using the SAR instruction to shift a signed integer 1 bit to
the right divides the value by 2.

.PP
Using the SAR instruction to perform a division operation does not
produce the same result as the IDIV instruction. The quotient from the
IDIV instruction is rounded toward zero, whereas the “quotient” of the
SAR instruction is rounded toward negative infinity. This difference is
apparent only for negative numbers. For example, when the IDIV
instruction is used to divide -9 by 4, the result is -2 with a remainder
of -1. If the SAR instruction is used to shift -9 right by two bits, the
result is -3 and the “remainder” is +3; however, the SAR instruction
stores only the most significant bit of the remainder (in the CF flag).

.PP
The OF flag is affected only on 1-bit shifts. For left shifts, the OF
flag is set to 0 if the most-significant bit of the result is the same
as the CF flag (that is, the top two bits of the original operand were
the same); otherwise, it is set to 1. For the SAR instruction, the OF
flag is cleared for all 1-bit shifts. For the SHR instruction, the OF
flag is set to the most-significant bit of the original operand.

.PP
In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits and
the mask width for CL is 5 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R
permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in
the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64-bits and sets the mask width
for CL to 6 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section
for encoding data and limits.

.SH IA-32 ARCHITECTURE COMPATIBILITY  href="./sal:sar:shl:shr.html#ia-32-architecture-compatibility"
class="anchor">¶

.PP
The 8086 does not mask the shift count. However, all other IA-32
processors (starting with the Intel 286 processor) do mask the shift
count to 5 bits, resulting in a maximum count of 31. This masking is
done in all operating modes (including the virtual-8086 mode) to reduce
the maximum execution time of the instructions.

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
The CF flag contains the value of the last bit shifted out of the
destination operand; it is undefined for SHL and SHR instructions where
the count is greater than or equal to the size (in bits) of the
destination operand. The OF flag is affected only for 1-bit shifts (see
“Description” above); otherwise, it is undefined. The SF, ZF, and PF
flags are set according to the result. If the count is 0, the flags are
not affected. For a non-zero count, the AF flag is undefined.
