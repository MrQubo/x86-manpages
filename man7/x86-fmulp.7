.SH DESCRIPTION
Multiplies the destination and source operands and stores the product in
the destination location. The destination operand is always an FPU data
register; the source operand can be an FPU data register or a memory
location. Source operands in memory can be in single precision or double
precision floating-point format or in word or doubleword integer format.

.PP
The no-operand version of the instruction multiplies the contents of the
ST(1) register by the contents of the ST(0) register and stores the
product in the ST(1) register. The one-operand version multiplies the
contents of the ST(0) register by the contents of a memory location
(either a floating-point or an integer value) and stores the product in
the ST(0) register. The two-operand version, multiplies the contents of
the ST(0) register by the contents of the ST(i) register, or vice versa,
with the result being stored in the register specified with the first
operand (the destination operand).

.PP
The FMULP instructions perform the additional operation of popping the
FPU register stack after storing the product. To pop the register stack,
the processor marks the ST(0) register as empty and increments the stack
pointer (TOP) by 1. The no-operand version of the floating-point
multiply instructions always results in the register stack being popped.
In some assemblers, the mnemonic for this instruction is FMUL rather
than FMULP.

.PP
The FIMUL instructions convert an integer source operand to double
extended-precision floating-point format before performing the
multiplication.

.PP
The sign of the result is always the exclusive-OR of the source signs,
even if one or more of the values being multiplied is 0 or ∞. When the
source operand is an integer 0, it is treated as a +0.

.PP
The following table shows the results obtained when multiplying various
classes of numbers, assuming that neither overflow nor underflow occurs.
