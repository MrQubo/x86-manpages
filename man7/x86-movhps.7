.SH DESCRIPTION
This instruction cannot be used for register to register or memory to
memory moves.

.PP
128-bit Legacy SSE load:

.PP
Moves two packed single precision floating-point values from the source
64-bit memory operand and stores them in the high 64-bits of the
destination XMM register. The lower 64bits of the XMM register are
preserved. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding destination register
are preserved.

.PP
VEX.128 & EVEX encoded load:

.PP
Loads two single precision floating-point values from the source 64-bit
memory operand (the third operand) and stores it in the upper 64-bits of
the destination XMM register (first operand). The low 64-bits from the
first source operand (the second operand) are copied to the lower
64-bits of the destination. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding
destination register are zeroed.

.PP
128-bit store:

.PP
Stores two packed single precision floating-point values from the high
64-bits of the XMM register source (second operand) to the 64-bit memory
location (first operand).

.PP
Note: VMOVHPS (store) (VEX.128.0F 17 /r) is legal and has the same
behavior as the existing 0F 17 store. For VMOVHPS (store) VEX.vvvv and
EVEX.vvvv are reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instruction will
#UD.

.PP
If VMOVHPS is encoded with VEX.L or EVEX.L’L= 1, an attempt to execute
the instruction encoded with VEX.L or EVEX.L’L= 1 will cause an #UD
exception.
