\fBOpcode\fP	\fB\fP	\fBMode\fP	\fBLeg Mode\fP	\fBDescription\fP
D9 FC				Round ST(0) to an integer.
.TE

.SH DESCRIPTION
Rounds the source value in the ST(0) register to the nearest integral
value, depending on the current rounding mode (setting of the RC field
of the FPU control word), and stores the result in ST(0).

.PP
If the source value is ∞, the value is not changed. If the source value
is not an integral value, the floating-point inexact-result exception
(#P) is generated.

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.

.SH OPERATION

ST(0) := RoundToIntegralValue(ST(0));
