.SH DESCRIPTION
Converts two packed signed doubleword integers in the source operand
(second operand) to two packed single precision floating-point values in
the destination operand (first operand).

.PP
The source operand can be an MMX technology register or a 64-bit memory
location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The results are
stored in the low quadword of the destination operand, and the high
quadword remains unchanged. When a conversion is inexact, the value
returned is rounded according to the rounding control bits in the MXCSR
register.

.PP
This instruction causes a transition from x87 FPU to MMX technology
operation (that is, the x87 FPU top-of-stack pointer is set to 0 and the
x87 FPU tag word is set to all 0s [valid]). If this instruction is
executed while an x87 FPU floating-point exception is pending, the
exception is handled before the CVTPI2PS instruction is executed.

.PP
In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to
access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).

.SH OPERATION
.EX
DEST[31:0] := Convert_Integer_To_Single_Precision_Floating_Point(SRC[31:0]);
DEST[63:32] := Convert_Integer_To_Single_Precision_Floating_Point(SRC[63:32]);
(* High quadword of destination unchanged *)
