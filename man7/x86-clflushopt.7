.SH DESCRIPTION
Invalidates from every level of the cache hierarchy in the cache
coherence domain the cache line that contains the linear address
specified with the memory operand. If that cache line contains modified
data at any level of the cache hierarchy, that data is written back to
memory. The source operand is a byte memory location.

.PP
The availability of CLFLUSHOPT is indicated by the presence of the CPUID
feature flag CLFLUSHOPT (CPUID.(EAX=07H,ECX=0H):EBX[bit 23]). The
aligned cache line size affected is also indicated with the CPUID
instruction (bits 8 through 15 of the EBX register when the initial
value in the EAX register is 1).

.PP
The memory attribute of the page containing the affected line has no
effect on the behavior of this instruction. It should be noted that
processors are free to speculatively fetch and cache data from system
memory regions assigned a memory-type allowing for speculative reads
(such as, the WB, WC, and WT memory types). PREFETCH\fIh\fP instructions can
be used to provide the processor with hints for this speculative
behavior. Because this speculative fetching can occur at any time and is
not tied to instruction execution, the CLFLUSH instruction is not
ordered with respect to PREFETCH\fIh\fP instructions or any of the
speculative fetching mechanisms (that is, data can be speculatively
loaded into a cache line just before, during, or after the execution of
a CLFLUSH instruction that references the cache line).

.PP
Executions of the CLFLUSHOPT instruction are ordered with respect to
fence instructions and to locked read-modify-write instructions; they
are also ordered with respect to older writes to the cache line being
invalidated. They are not ordered with respect to other executions of
CLFLUSHOPT, to executions of CLFLUSH and CLWB, or to younger writes to
the cache line being invalidated. Software can use the SFENCE
instruction to order an execution of CLFLUSHOPT relative to one of those
operations.

.PP
The CLFLUSHOPT instruction can be used at all privilege levels and is
subject to all permission checking and faults associated with a byte
load (and in addition, a CLFLUSHOPT instruction is allowed to flush a
linear address in an execute-only segment). Like a load, the CLFLUSHOPT
instruction sets the A bit but not the D bit in the page tables.

.PP
In some implementations, the CLFLUSHOPT instruction may always cause
transactional abort with Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX).
The CLFLUSHOPT instruction is not expected to be commonly used inside
typical transactional regions. However, programmers must not rely on
CLFLUSHOPT instruction to force a transactional abort, since whether
they cause transactional abort is implementation dependent.

.PP
CLFLUSHOPT operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.
