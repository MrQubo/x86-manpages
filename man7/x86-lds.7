.SH DESCRIPTION
Loads a far pointer (segment selector and offset) from the second
operand (source operand) into a segment register and the first operand
(destination operand). The source operand specifies a 48-bit or a 32-bit
pointer in memory depending on the current setting of the operand-size
attribute (32 bits or 16 bits, respectively). The instruction opcode and
the destination operand specify a segment register/general-purpose
register pair. The 16-bit segment selector from the source operand is
loaded into the segment register specified with the opcode (DS, SS, ES,
FS, or GS). The 32-bit or 16-bit offset is loaded into the register
specified with the destination operand.

.PP
If one of these instructions is executed in protected mode, additional
information from the segment descriptor pointed to by the segment
selector in the source operand is loaded in the hidden part of the
selected segment register.

.PP
Also in protected mode, a NULL selector (values 0000 through 0003) can
be loaded into DS, ES, FS, or GS registers without causing a protection
exception. (Any subsequent reference to a segment whose corresponding
segment register is loaded with a NULL selector, causes a
general-protection exception (#GP) and no memory reference to the
segment occurs.)

.PP
In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits.
Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to specify a
source operand referencing an 80-bit pointer (16-bit selector, 64-bit
offset) in memory. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits
access to additional registers (R8-R15). See the summary chart at the
beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.
