.SH DESCRIPTION
Copies the value from the second operand (source operand) to the I/O
port specified with the destination operand (first operand). The source
operand can be register AL, AX, or EAX, depending on the size of the
port being accessed (8, 16, or 32 bits, respectively); the destination
operand can be a byte-immediate or the DX register. Using a byte
immediate allows I/O port addresses 0 to 255 to be accessed; using the
DX register as a source operand allows I/O ports from 0 to 65,535 to be
accessed.

.PP
The size of the I/O port being accessed is determined by the opcode for
an 8-bit I/O port or by the operand-size attribute of the instruction
for a 16- or 32-bit I/O port.

.PP
At the machine code level, I/O instructions are shorter when accessing
8-bit I/O ports. Here, the upper eight bits of the port address will be
0.

.PP
This instruction is only useful for accessing I/O ports located in the
processor’s I/O address space. See Chapter 19, “Input/Output,” in the
Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s
Manual, Volume 1, for more information on accessing I/O ports in the I/O
address space.

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.

.SH IA-32 ARCHITECTURE COMPATIBILITY
After executing an OUT instruction, the Pentium® processor
ensures that the EWBE# pin has been sampled active before it begins to
execute the next instruction. (Note that the instruction can be
prefetched if EWBE# is not active, but it will not be executed until the
EWBE# pin is sampled active.) Only the Pentium processor family has the
EWBE# pin.
