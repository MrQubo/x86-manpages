.SH DESCRIPTION
FISTTP converts the value in ST into a signed integer using truncation
(chop) as rounding mode, transfers the result to the destination, and
pop ST. FISTTP accepts word, short integer, and long integer
destinations.

.PP
The following table shows the results obtained when storing various
classes of numbers in integer format.

.PP
.RS

.PP
F Meansfinitefloating-pointvalue.

.PP
Ι Means integer.

.PP
∗ Indicates floating-point invalid-operation (#IA) exception.

.RE

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.

.SH OPERATION
.EX
DEST := ST;
pop ST;
.EE

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
C1 is cleared; C0, C2, C3 undefined.

.SH NUMERIC EXCEPTIONS
Invalid, Stack Invalid (stack underflow), Precision.
