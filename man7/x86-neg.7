.SH DESCRIPTION
Replaces the value of operand (the destination operand) with its two's
complement. (This operation is equivalent to subtracting the operand
from 0.) The destination operand is located in a general-purpose
register or a memory location.

.PP
This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction
to be executed atomically.

.PP
In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits.
Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional
registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes
operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of this
section for encoding data and limits.

.SH OPERATION
.EX
IF DEST = 0
    THEN CF := 0;
    ELSE CF := 1;
FI;
DEST := [– (DEST)]
.EE

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
The CF flag set to 0 if the source operand is 0; otherwise it is set
to 1. The OF, SF, ZF, AF, and PF flags are set according to the result.
