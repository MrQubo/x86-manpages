.SH DESCRIPTION
Adds the destination operand (first operand), the source operand (second
operand), and the carry (CF) flag and stores the result in the
destination operand. The destination operand can be a register or a
memory location; the source operand can be an immediate, a register, or
a memory location. (However, two memory operands cannot be used in one
instruction.) The state of the CF flag represents a carry from a
previous addition. When an immediate value is used as an operand, it is
sign-extended to the length of the destination operand format.

.PP
The ADC instruction does not distinguish between signed or unsigned
operands. Instead, the processor evaluates the result for both data
types and sets the OF and CF flags to indicate a carry in the signed or
unsigned result, respectively. The SF flag indicates the sign of the
signed result.

.PP
The ADC instruction is usually executed as part of a multibyte or
multiword addition in which an ADD instruction is followed by an ADC
instruction.

.PP
This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction
to be executed atomically.

.PP
In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits.
Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional
registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes
operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of this
section for encoding data and limits.
