.SH DESCRIPTION
Invalidates any translation lookaside buffer (TLB) entries specified
with the source operand. The source operand is a memory address. The
processor determines the page that contains that address and flushes all
TLB entries for that page.1

.PP
The INVLPG instruction is a privileged instruction. When the processor
is running in protected mode, the CPL must be 0 to execute this
instruction.

.PP
The INVLPG instruction normally flushes TLB entries only for the
specified page; however, in some cases, it may flush more entries, even
the entire TLB. The instruction invalidates TLB entries associated with
the current PCID and may or may not do so for TLB entries associated
with other PCIDs. (If PCIDs are disabled — CR4.PCIDE = 0 — the current
PCID is 000H.) The instruction also invalidates any global TLB entries
for the specified page, regardless of PCID.

.PP
For more details on operations that flush the TLB, see “MOV—Move to/from
Control Registers” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures
Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2B, and Section 4.10.4.1,
“Operations that Invalidate TLBs and Paging-Structure Caches,” in the
Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s
Manual, Volume 3A.

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in all non-64-bit modes. It
also operates the same in 64-bit mode, except if the memory address is
in non-canonical form. In this case, INVLPG is the same as a NOP.

.SH IA-32 ARCHITECTURE COMPATIBILITY  href="invlpg.html#ia-32-architecture-compatibility"
class="anchor">¶

.PP
The INVLPG instruction is implementation dependent, and its function may
be implemented differently on different families of Intel 64 or IA-32
processors. This instruction is not supported on IA-32 processors
earlier than the Intel486 processor.

1\&. If the paging structures map the linear address using a page
larger than 4 KBytes and there are multiple TLB entries for that page
(see Section 4.10.2.3, “Details of TLB Use,” in the Intel®
64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A),
the instruction invalidates all of them.
