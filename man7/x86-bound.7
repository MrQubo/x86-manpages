.SH DESCRIPTION
BOUND determines if the first operand (array index) is within the bounds
of an array specified the second operand (bounds operand). The array
index is a signed integer located in a register. The bounds operand is a
memory location that contains a pair of signed doubleword-integers (when
the operand-size attribute is 32) or a pair of signed word-integers
(when the operand-size attribute is 16). The first doubleword (or word)
is the lower bound of the array and the second doubleword (or word) is
the upper bound of the array. The array index must be greater than or
equal to the lower bound and less than or equal to the upper bound plus
the operand size in bytes. If the index is not within bounds, a BOUND
range exceeded exception (#BR) is signaled. When this exception is
generated, the saved return instruction pointer points to the BOUND
instruction.

.PP
The bounds limit data structure (two words or doublewords containing the
lower and upper limits of the array) is usually placed just before the
array itself, making the limits addressable via a constant offset from
the beginning of the array. Because the address of the array already
will be present in a register, this practice avoids extra bus cycles to
obtain the effective address of the array bounds.

.PP
This instruction executes as described in compatibility mode and legacy
mode. It is not valid in 64-bit mode.
