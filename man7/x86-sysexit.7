.SH DESCRIPTION
Executes a fast return to privilege level 3 user code. SYSEXIT is a
companion instruction to the SYSENTER instruction. The instruction is
optimized to provide the maximum performance for returns from system
procedures executing at protections levels 0 to user procedures
executing at protection level 3. It must be executed from code executing
at privilege level 0.

.PP
With a 64-bit operand size, SYSEXIT remains in 64-bit mode; otherwise,
it either enters compatibility mode (if the logical processor is in
IA-32e mode) or remains in protected mode (if it is not).

.PP
Prior to executing SYSEXIT, software must specify the privilege level 3
code segment and code entry point, and the privilege level 3 stack
segment and stack pointer by writing values into the following MSR and
general-purpose registers:
.IP \(bu 2
\fBIA32_SYSENTER_CS\fP (MSR address 174H) — Contains a 32-bit value
that is used to determine the segment selectors for the privilege
level 3 code and stack segments (see the Operation section)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBRDX\fP — The canonical address in this register is loaded into RIP
(thus, this value references the first instruction to be executed in
the user code). If the return is not to 64-bit mode, only bits 31:0
are loaded.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBECX\fP — The canonical address in this register is loaded into RSP
(thus, this value contains the stack pointer for the privilege level
3 stack). If the return is not to 64-bit mode, only bits 31:0 are
loaded.

.PP
The IA32_SYSENTER_CS MSR can be read from and written to using RDMSR
and WRMSR.

.PP
While SYSEXIT loads the CS and SS selectors with values derived from the
IA32_SYSENTER_CS MSR, the CS and SS descriptor caches are \fBnot\fP
loaded from the descriptors (in GDT or LDT) referenced by those
selectors. Instead, the descriptor caches are loaded with fixed values.
See the Operation section for details. It is the responsibility of OS
software to ensure that the descriptors (in GDT or LDT) referenced by
those selector values correspond to the fixed values loaded into the
descriptor caches; the SYSEXIT instruction does not ensure this
correspondence.

.PP
The SYSEXIT instruction can be invoked from all operating modes except
real-address mode and virtual-8086 mode.

.PP
The SYSENTER and SYSEXIT instructions were introduced into the IA-32
architecture in the Pentium II processor. The availability of these
instructions on a processor is indicated with the SYSENTER/SYSEXIT
present (SEP) feature flag returned to the EDX register by the CPUID
instruction. An operating system that qualifies the SEP flag must also
qualify the processor family and model to ensure that the
SYSENTER/SYSEXIT instructions are actually present. For example:

.PP
IF CPUID SEP bit is set

.PP
THEN IF (Family = 6) and (Model &lt; 3) and (Stepping &lt; 3)

.PP
THEN

.PP
SYSENTER/SYSEXIT_Not_Supported; FI;

.PP
ELSE

.PP
SYSENTER/SYSEXIT_Supported; FI;

.PP
FI;

.PP
When the CPUID instruction is executed on the Pentium Pro processor
(model 1), the processor returns a the SEP flag as set, but does not
support the SYSENTER/SYSEXIT instructions.

.PP
When shadow stacks are enabled at privilege level 3 the instruction
loads SSP with value from IA32_PL3_SSP MSR. Refer to Chapter 6,
“Interrupt and Exception Handling‚” and Chapter 17, “Control-flow
Enforcement Technology (CET)‚” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32
Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for additional CET
details.

.PP
\fBInstruction ordering.\fP Instructions following a SYSEXIT may be
fetched from memory before earlier instructions complete execution, but
they will not execute (even speculatively) until all instructions prior
to the SYSEXIT have completed execution (the later instructions may
execute before data stored by the earlier instructions have become
globally visible).
