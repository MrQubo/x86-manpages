.SS DESCRIPTION
The ENQCMDS instruction allows system software to write commands to
\fBenqueue registers\fP, which are special device registers accessed using
memory-mapped I/O (MMIO).

.PP
Enqueue registers expect writes to have the format given in Figure
3-16
\[la]enqcmd.html#fig\-3\-16\[ra] and explained in the section on
“ENQCMD—Enqueue Command.”

.PP
The ENQCMDS instruction begins by reading 64 bytes of command data from
its source memory operand. This is an ordinary load with cacheability
and memory ordering implied normally by the memory type. The source
operand need not be aligned, and there is no guarantee that all 64 bytes
are loaded atomically. Bits 30:20 of the source operand must be zero.

.PP
ENQCMDS formats its source data differently from ENQCMD. Specifically,
it formats them into \fBcommand data\fP as follows:
.IP \(bu 2
Command[19:0] get bits 19:0 of the source operand that was read
from memory. These 20 bits communicate a process address-space
identifier (PASID).
.IP \(bu 2
Command[30:20] are zero.
.IP \(bu 2
Command[511:31] get bits 511:31 of the source operand that was
read from memory. Bit 31 communicates a privilege identification (0
= user; 1 = supervisor).

.PP
The ENQCMDS instruction then uses an \fBenqueue store\fP (defined below)
to write this command data to the destination operand. The address of
the destination operand is specified in a general-purpose register as an
offset into the ES segment (the segment cannot be
overridden).1 The destination linear address must be 64-byte
aligned. The operation of an enqueue store disregards the memory type of
the destination memory address.

In64-bitmode,thewidthoftheregisteroperandis64bits(32bitswitha67Hprefix).Outside64-bitmodewhenCS.D=
1, the width is 32 bits (16 bits with a 67H prefix). Outside 64-bit
mode when CS.D=0, the width is 16 bits (32 bits with a 67H prefix).

.RE

.PP
An enqueue store is not ordered relative to older stores to WB or WC
memory (including non-temporal stores) or to executions of the
CLFLUSHOPT or CLWB (when applied to addresses other than that of the
enqueue store). Software can enforce such ordering by executing a
fencing instruction such as SFENCE or MFENCE before the enqueue store.

.PP
An enqueue store does not write the data into the cache hierarchy, nor
does it fetch any data into the cache hierarchy. An enqueue store’s
command data is never combined with that of any other store to the same
address.

.PP
Unlike other stores, an enqueue store returns a status, which the
ENQCMDS instruction loads into the ZF flag in the RFLAGS register:
.IP \(bu 2
ZF = 0 (success) reports that the 64-byte command data was written
atomically to a device’s enqueue register and has been accepted by
the device. (It does not guarantee that the device has acted on the
command; it may have queued it for later execution.)
.IP \(bu 2
ZF = 1 (retry) reports that the command data was not accepted. This
status is returned if the destination address is an enqueue register
but the command was not accepted due to capacity or other temporal
reasons.

.PP
This status is also returned if the destination address was not an
enqueue register (including the case of a memory address); in these
cases, the store is dropped and is written neither to MMIO nor to
memory.

.PP
The ENQCMDS instruction may be executed only if CPL = 0. Availability of
the ENQCMDS instruction is indicated by the presence of the CPUID
feature flag ENQCMD (CPUID.(EAX=07H, ECX=0H):ECX[bit 29]).
