.SH DESCRIPTION
Stops instruction execution and places the processor in a HALT state. An
enabled interrupt (including NMI and SMI), a debug exception, the BINIT#
signal, the INIT# signal, or the RESET# signal will resume execution. If
an interrupt (including NMI) is used to resume execution after a HLT
instruction, the saved instruction pointer (CS:EIP) points to the
instruction following the HLT instruction.

.PP
When a HLT instruction is executed on an Intel 64 or IA-32 processor
supporting Intel Hyper-Threading Technology, only the logical processor
that executes the instruction is halted. The other logical processors in
the physical processor remain active, unless they are each individually
halted by executing a HLT instruction.

.PP
The HLT instruction is a privileged instruction. When the processor is
running in protected or virtual-8086 mode, the privilege level of a
program or procedure must be 0 to execute the HLT instruction.

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.
