.SH DESCRIPTION
Fetches the line of data from memory that contains the byte specified
with the source operand to a location in the cache hierarchy specified
by a locality hint:
.IP \(bu 2
T0 (temporal data)—prefetch data into all levels of the cache
hierarchy.
.IP \(bu 2
T1 (temporal data with respect to first level cache misses)—prefetch
data into level 2 cache and higher.
.IP \(bu 2
T2 (temporal data with respect to second level cache
misses)—prefetch data into level 3 cache and higher, or an
implementation-specific choice.
.IP \(bu 2
NTA (non-temporal data with respect to all cache levels)—prefetch
data into non-temporal cache structure and into a location close to
the processor, minimizing cache pollution.

.PP
The source operand is a byte memory location. (The locality hints are
encoded into the machine level instruction using bits 3 through 5 of the
ModR/M byte.)

.PP
If the line selected is already present in the cache hierarchy at a
level closer to the processor, no data movement occurs. Prefetches from
uncacheable or WC memory are ignored.

.PP
The PREFETCH\fIh\fP instruction is merely a hint and does not affect program
behavior. If executed, this instruction moves data closer to the
processor in anticipation of future use.

.PP
The implementation of prefetch locality hints is
implementation-dependent, and can be overloaded or ignored by a
processor implementation. The amount of data prefetched is also
processor implementation-dependent. It will, however, be a minimum of 32
bytes. Additional details of the implementation-dependent locality hints
are described in Section 7.4 of Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures
Optimization Reference Manual.

.PP
It should be noted that processors are free to speculatively fetch and
cache data from system memory regions that are assigned a memory-type
that permits speculative reads (that is, the WB, WC, and WT memory
types). A PREFETCH\fIh\fP instruction is considered a hint to this
speculative behavior. Because this speculative fetching can occur at any
time and is not tied to instruction execution, a PREFETCH\fIh\fP instruction
is not ordered with respect to the fence instructions (MFENCE, SFENCE,
and LFENCE) or locked memory references. A PREFETCH\fIh\fP instruction is
also unordered with respect to CLFLUSH and CLFLUSHOPT instructions,
other PREFETCH\fIh\fP instructions, or any other general instruction. It is
ordered with respect to serializing instructions such as CPUID, WRMSR,
OUT, and MOV CR.

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.

.EX
void _mm_prefetch(char *p, int i)

The argument “*p” gives the address of the byte (and corresponding cache line) to be prefetched. The value “i” gives a constant (_MM_HINT_T0, _MM_HINT_T1, _MM_HINT_T2, or _MM_HINT_NTA) that specifies the type of prefetch operation to be performed.
