.SH DESCRIPTION
This instruction performs no operation. It is a one-byte or multi-byte
NOP that takes up space in the instruction stream but does not impact
machine context, except for the EIP register.

.PP
The multi-byte form of NOP is available on processors with model
encoding:
.IP \(bu 2
CPUID.01H.EAX[Bytes 11:8] = 0110B or 1111B

.PP
The multi-byte NOP instruction does not alter the content of a register
and will not issue a memory operation. The instruction’s operation is
the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.

.SH OPERATION
.EX
The one-byte NOP instruction is an alias mnemonic for the XCHG (E)AX, (E)AX instruction.
The multi-byte NOP instruction performs no operation on supported processors and generates undefined opcode
exception on processors that do not support the multi-byte NOP instruction.
The memory operand form of the instruction allows software to create a byte sequence of “no operation” as one
instruction. For situations where multiple-byte NOPs are needed, the recommended operations (32-bit mode and
64-bit mode) are:
.EE

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
None.

.SH EXCEPTIONS (ALL OPERATING MODES)
#UD If the LOCK prefix is used.
