.SH DESCRIPTION
Separates the source value in the ST(0) register into its exponent and
significand, stores the exponent in ST(0), and pushes the significand
onto the register stack. Following this operation, the new top-of-stack
register ST(0) contains the value of the original significand expressed
as a floating-point value. The sign and significand of this value are
the same as those found in the source operand, and the exponent is 3FFFH
(biased value for a true exponent of zero). The ST(1) register contains
the value of the original operand’s true (unbiased) exponent expressed
as a floating-point value. (The operation performed by this instruction
is a superset of the IEEE-recommended logb(\fIx\fP) function.)

.PP
This instruction and the F2XM1 instruction are useful for performing
power and range scaling operations. The FXTRACT instruction is also
useful for converting numbers in double extended-precision
floating-point format to decimal representations (e.g., for printing or
displaying).

.PP
If the floating-point zero-divide exception (#Z) is masked and the
source operand is zero, an exponent value of –∞ is stored in register
ST(1) and 0 with the sign of the source operand is stored in register
ST(0).

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.
