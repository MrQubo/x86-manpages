.SH DESCRIPTION
STUI sets the user interrupt flag (UIF). Its effect takes place
immediately; a user interrupt may be delivered on the instruction
boundary following STUI. (This is in contrast with STI, whose effect is
delayed by one instruction).

.PP
An execution of STUI inside a transactional region causes a
transactional abort; the abort loads EAX as it would have had it been
due to an execution of STI.

.SH OPERATION

UIF := 1;
