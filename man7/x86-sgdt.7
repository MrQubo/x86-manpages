.SH DESCRIPTION
Stores the content of the global descriptor table register (GDTR) in the
destination operand. The destination operand specifies a memory
location.

.PP
In legacy or compatibility mode, the destination operand is a 6-byte
memory location. If the operand-size attribute is 16 or 32 bits, the
16-bit limit field of the register is stored in the low 2 bytes of the
memory location and the 32-bit base address is stored in the high 4
bytes.

.PP
In 64-bit mode, the operand size is fixed at 8+2 bytes. The instruction
stores an 8-byte base and a 2-byte limit.

.PP
SGDT is useful only by operating-system software. However, it can be
used in application programs without causing an exception to be
generated if CR4.UMIP = 0. See “LGDT/LIDT—Load Global/Interrupt
Descriptor Table Register” in Chapter 3, Intel® 64 and IA-32
Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A, for information on
loading the GDTR and IDTR.

.SH IA-32 ARCHITECTURE COMPATIBILITY  href="sgdt.html#ia-32-architecture-compatibility"
class="anchor">¶

.PP
The 16-bit form of the SGDT is compatible with the Intel 286 processor
if the upper 8 bits are not referenced. The Intel 286 processor fills
these bits with 1s; processor generations later than the Intel 286
processor fill these bits with 0s.

.SH OPERATION
.EX
IF instruction is SGDT
    IF OperandSize =16 or OperandSize = 32 (* Legacy or Compatibility Mode *)
        THEN
            DEST[0:15] := GDTR(Limit);
            DEST[16:47] := GDTR(Base); (* Full 32-bit base address stored *)
            FI;
        ELSE (* 64-bit Mode *)
            DEST[0:15] := GDTR(Limit);
            DEST[16:79] := GDTR(Base); (* Full 64-bit base address stored *)
