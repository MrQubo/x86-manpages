.SH DESCRIPTION
Invalidates (flushes) the processor’s internal caches and issues a
special-function bus cycle that directs external caches to also flush
themselves. Data held in internal caches is not written back to main
memory.

.PP
After executing this instruction, the processor does not wait for the
external caches to complete their flushing operation before proceeding
with instruction execution. It is the responsibility of hardware to
respond to the cache flush signal.

.PP
The INVD instruction is a privileged instruction. When the processor is
running in protected mode, the CPL of a program or procedure must be 0
to execute this instruction.

.PP
The INVD instruction may be used when the cache is used as temporary
memory and the cache contents need to be invalidated rather than written
back to memory. When the cache is used as temporary memory, no external
device should be actively writing data to main memory.

.PP
Use this instruction with care. Data cached internally and not written
back to main memory will be lost. Note that any data from an external
device to main memory (for example, via a PCIWrite) can be temporarily
stored in the caches; these data can be lost when an INVD instruction is
executed. Unless there is a specific requirement or benefit to flushing
caches without writing back modified cache lines (for example, temporary
memory, testing, or fault recovery where cache coherency with main
memory is not a concern), software should instead use the WBINVD
instruction.

.PP
On processors that support processor reserved memory, the INVD
instruction cannot be executed when processor reserved memory
protections are activated. See Section 36.5, “EPC and Management of EPC
Pages,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software
Developer’s Manual, Volume 3D.

.PP
Some processors prevent execution of INVD after BIOS execution is
complete. They report this by enumerating
CPUID.(EAX=07H,ECX=1H):EAX[bit 30] as 1. On such processors, INVD
cannot be executed if bit 0 of SR_BIOS_DONE (MSR address 151H) is 1.

.PP
This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit
mode.

.SH IA-32 ARCHITECTURE COMPATIBILITY  href="invd.html#ia-32-architecture-compatibility"
class="anchor">¶

.PP
The INVD instruction is implementation dependent; it may be implemented
differently on different families of Intel 64 or IA-32 processors. This
instruction is not supported on IA-32 processors earlier than the
Intel486 processor.
