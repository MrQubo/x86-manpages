.SH DESCRIPTION
UIRET returns from the handling of a user interrupt. It can be executed
regardless of CPL.

.PP
Execution of UIRET inside a transactional region causes a transactional
abort; the abort loads EAX as it would have had it been due to an
execution of IRET.

.PP
UIRET can be tracked by Architectural Last Branch Records (LBRs), Intel
Processor Trace (Intel PT), and Performance Monitoring. For both Intel
PT and LBRs, UIRET is recorded in precisely the same manner as IRET.
Hence for LBRs, UIRETs fall into the OTHER_BRANCH category, which
implies that IA32_LBR_CTL.OTHER_BRANCH[bit 22] must be set to
record user-interrupt delivery, and that the IA32_LBR_x_INFO.BR_TYPE
field will indicate OTHER_BRANCH for any recorded user interrupt. For
Intel PT, control flow tracing must be enabled by setting
IA32_RTIT_CTL.BranchEn[bit 13]\&.

.PP
UIRET will also increment performance counters for which counting
BR_INST_RETIRED.FAR_BRANCH is enabled.
