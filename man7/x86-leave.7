.SH DESCRIPTION
Releases the stack frame set up by an earlier ENTER instruction. The
LEAVE instruction copies the frame pointer (in the EBP register) into
the stack pointer register (ESP), which releases the stack space
allocated to the stack frame. The old frame pointer (the frame pointer
for the calling procedure that was saved by the ENTER instruction) is
then popped from the stack into the EBP register, restoring the calling
procedure’s stack frame.

.PP
A RET instruction is commonly executed following a LEAVE instruction to
return program control to the calling procedure.

.PP
See “Procedure Calls for Block-Structured Languages” in Chapter 7 of the
Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s
Manual, Volume 1, for detailed information on the use of the ENTER and
LEAVE instructions.

.PP
In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 64 bits;
32-bit operation cannot be encoded. See the summary chart at the
beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.
